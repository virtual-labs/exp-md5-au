 <h3>Theory</h2>
    <div>
        MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size 128-bit hash value from variable-length input data. This proposal outlines an educational exercise to simulate the MD5 hashing process through a web-based application, providing students with a practical understanding of how MD5 works.

  <h4>Use Of MD5 Algorithm:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>It is used for file authentication.</li>
        <li>In a web application, it is used for security purposes, e.g., to secure user passwords.</li>
        <li>Using this algorithm, we can store our password in a 128-bit format.</li>
    </ul>

 <h4>Application Of MD5 Algorithm:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We use message digest to verify the integrity of files/authenticate files.</li>
        <li>MD5 was used for data security and encryption.</li>
        <li>It is used to digest the message of any size and is also used for password verification.</li>
        <li>For game boards and graphics.</li>
    </ul>

 <h4>Advantages of MD5 Algorithm:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>MD5 is faster and simple to understand.</li>
        <li>MD5 algorithm generates a strong password in a 16-byte format. All developers, like web developers, use the MD5 algorithm to secure the passwords of users.</li>
        <li>To integrate the MD5 algorithm, relatively low memory is necessary.</li>
        <li>It is very easy and faster to generate a digest message of the original message.</li>
    </ul>
