### Theory
MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size 128-bit hash value from variable-length input data. This proposal outlines an educational exercise to simulate the MD5 hashing process through a web-based application, providing students with a practical understanding of how MD5 works.
This exercise serves to reinforce student understanding of MD5 hashing by allowing them to:

- Understand the core concepts of the MD5 algorithm.
- Explore the steps involved in MD5 hash generation.
- Witness the application of MD5 in practice.
- Gain insights into MD5's properties, including collision resistance.
