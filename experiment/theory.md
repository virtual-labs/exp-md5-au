### **Theory**  

<div>

MD5 (**Message Digest Algorithm 5**) is a widely used **cryptographic hash function** that produces a **fixed-size 128-bit hash value** from variable-length input data. It is commonly used for **data integrity verification** and **checksums**, though it is no longer considered secure for cryptographic applications due to vulnerabilities like **collision attacks**.  

This proposal outlines an educational exercise that simulates the **MD5 hashing process** through a web-based application, providing students with a **practical understanding** of how MD5 works.

### **Use of MD5 Algorithm**  
- **File Authentication** – MD5 is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of files by generating a unique hash value.  
- **Web Application Security** – It was historically used to secure user passwords, though it is now considered vulnerable to attacks.  
- **Password Storage** – This algorithm allows storing passwords in a **128-bit hashed format** instead of plaintext.  
- **Data Integrity Checks** – It helps detect accidental modifications in files by comparing hash values.

### **Applications of MD5 Algorithm**  
- **File Integrity Verification** – MD5 is widely used to ensure files have not been altered by comparing their hash values.  
- **Digital Signatures** – It was used in cryptographic applications to sign and verify documents.  
- **Password Verification** – MD5 can be used to store and compare hashed passwords for authentication purposes.  
- **Checksums in Software Distribution** – Developers use MD5 to provide a checksum for verifying software downloads.  
- **Gaming and Graphics** – Some game engines and applications utilize MD5 hashing for data management and verification.
