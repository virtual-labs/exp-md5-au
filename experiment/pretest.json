        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 is not used for encrypting data.",
        "b": "Explanation: MD5 is primarily used for hashing data, creating a fixed-size hash value from variable-size input data. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 is actually very fast, which contributed to its early adoption.",
        "b": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 produces deterministic hash values for the same input.",
        "c": "Explanation: MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning two different inputs can produce the same hash. This makes it insecure for cryptographic purposes. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. While SHA-1 is more secure than MD5, it is also considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks.",
        "b": "Explanation: SHA-256 is considered more secure and is widely recommended for cryptographic applications. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2'>here</a>",
        "c": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD4 is an older and even weaker hash function than MD5.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Brute force attacks try all possible inputs but do not specifically target hash collisions.",
        "b": "Explanation: A collision attack occurs when an attacker finds two different inputs that produce the same MD5 hash, making it insecure for cryptographic purposes. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",
        "c": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Rainbow table attacks are used to reverse hashed passwords, not generate collisions.",
