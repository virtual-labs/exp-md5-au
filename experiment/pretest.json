        "a": "Explanation: MD5 stands for Message Digest algorithm 5. It is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",

        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 is not used for encrypting data.",
        "b": "Explanation: MD5 is primarily used for hashing data, creating a fixed-size hash value from variable-size input data. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",

      "question": "What is a major security issue with MD5?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is too slow for modern applications",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 is actually very fast, which contributed to its early adoption.",
        "b": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. MD5 produces deterministic hash values for the same input.",
        "c": "Explanation: MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning two different inputs can produce the same hash. This makes it insecure for cryptographic purposes. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Padding happens before dividing into 512-bit blocks.",
        "b": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Appending the message length happens after padding.",
        "c": "Explanation: Correct! During this step, the input is divided into 512-bit blocks, and each block is processed to generate the final hash.",
        "d": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. The final hash is generated after processing all blocks."

      "question": "Which type of attack allows an attacker to generate two different inputs with the same MD5 hash?",

        "c": "Rainbow table attack",
        "d": "Side-channel attack"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Brute force attacks try all possible inputs but do not specifically target hash collisions.",
        "b": "Explanation: A collision attack occurs when an attacker finds two different inputs that produce the same MD5 hash, making it insecure for cryptographic purposes. More information can be found <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5'>here</a>",
        "c": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Rainbow table attacks are used to reverse hashed passwords, not generate collisions.",
        "d": "Explanation: Incorrect answer. Side-channel attacks exploit hardware weaknesses, not hash functions."
